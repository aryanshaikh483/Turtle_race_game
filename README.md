<h1 align= center>TURTLE RACE GAME</h1>

 
<p>This project implements a Turtle Race Game using Python's Turtle module. The game allows users to place bets on which colored turtle will win the race. Six turtles, each assigned a unique color, start from a fixed position and move forward randomly until one crosses the finish line. The game uses randomized movement to determine the winner, ensuring an unpredictable outcome. The player's bet is checked against the winning turtle, and the result is displayed accordingly. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of event handling, user input, loops, and randomization, making it a great introduction to graphical programming in Python.</p>
